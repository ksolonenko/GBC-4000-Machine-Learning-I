Ex-1: Introduction to GitHub Submission Process
Overview
In this assignment, you will familiarize yourself with the GitHub submission process.

Objectives
Get comfortable with GitHub submission process by completing a function to output your name.
Push the changes and successfully run autograde.
The Assignment
The file 'get_a_point_for_writing_your_name.py' contain methods that are incomplete. The current tests are failing because this method isn't providing the correct output. You are required to fix them up and ensure the test passes for a successful submission.

Validating and Evaluating Your Results

After committing and pushing your code, check the mark on the top line (near the commit ID).
If some tests are failing, click on the ‚ùå to open up a popup, which will show details about the errors.
You can click the Details link to see what went wrong. Pay special attention to lines with the words "Failed" or "error".

Locally
You can test your code locally by installing and running pytest (pip install pytest or conda install pytest).
Run the tests using the command pytest in your terminal. This will show the status of each test and any errors that occurred.
Best of luck!
